guash is an interpreter that implements the GuaraScript programming language.

The GuaraScript programming language provides facilities for the development
of scientific applications, games and computer simulations, such as
CAS (Computer Algebra System), including support for operations with
complex numbers, linear algebra and numerical computation,
database access (SQLite), cross-platform development (currently Linux,
Mac OS X and Windows), supports 3D graphics using
OpenGL ES (emulated using OpenGL 1.2), GLUT and GLWM, and development of web applications (server side).

The complete documentation, including the EBNF grammar file and
the interpreter's flowcharts can be found in the doc directory.
